## ABCDEFGHIJKLMN

The way `npm audit` works is broken. Its rollout as a default after every `npm install` was rushed, inconsiderate, and inadequate for the front-end tooling.

In this post, I will briefly outline how it works, why itâ€™s broken, and what changes Iâ€™m hoping to see.

```ts
const Hello: string = "Hello World!";
```

_Note: this article is written with a critical and somewhat snarky tone. I understand
itâ€™s super hard to maintain massive projects like Node.js/npm, and that mistakes may
take a while to become become apparent. I am frustrated only at the situation,
not at the people involved. I kept the snarky tone because the level of my
frustration has increased over the years, and I donâ€™t want to pretend that
the situation isnâ€™t as dire as it really is. Most of all I am frustrated
to see all the people for whom this is the first programming experience,
as well as all the people who are blocked from deploying their changes
due to irrelevant warnings ðŸ’œ_
